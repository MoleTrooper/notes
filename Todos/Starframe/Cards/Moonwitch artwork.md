Particle effects for this artwork will be done with Starframe.
What we need:

- [x] point lights
- [x] line renderer (port from dexterior)
- [x] 3D poses not strictly necessary but helpful
- [ ] sRGB albedo texture?
- [ ] unlit version of the shading pass
- [ ] offset light volumes to the edge of the radius
- [ ] fix the line renderer gap bug
- [ ] remove the dark edge of the clouds somehow (alpha threshold from material?)
