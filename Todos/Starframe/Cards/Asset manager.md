Work is well underway on getting assets into one controlled place.
Prerequisite to [[Blender as a level editor]].

Thoughts:

Is there a "default animation" we could play automatically for animated meshes?
It's a hassle to remember to start the animation
for meshes that have just one that loops forever.
Maybe just the first one encountered?

Might be nice to prune identical animators
so that the user doesn't need to be super careful
about playing the same thing many times
(is this actually a problem? use the API a bunch to see)
