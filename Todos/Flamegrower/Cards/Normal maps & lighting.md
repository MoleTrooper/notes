Not so sure about this one since I'm largely going for a flat style,
but it would be an interesting experiment to add some 2D lighting.
If I make my graphics with meshes it wouldn't be very hard to
add some sideways-pointing normals near edges by pushing
the vertices back in space. Baking from a sculpted high-density mesh
would also be an option, but this seems like a lot of work.

Light could make fire flowers really pop, and maybe even be used
for some cheeky mechanics where you can only see in some areas if you
have a fire charged up. OTOH full dynamic lighting is not really necessary
for that to work.
