They would need to be able to be stopped by attaching them
to something static with a vine. Maybe simply driving them
with a finite-powered motor constraint would do.
Possible problem is stopping for unrelated reasons,
but maybe that can be actually desirable as well.

An interesting mechanic would be having windmills
drive some other mechanisms like moving platforms.
This might be doable with a constraint, but not sure
if that's the right solution here.

This could also work the other way around, maybe in some level
you actually need to pull on a platform to get a windmill
in the right position. All sorts of coupling like this
could be interesting, not just for windmills.
