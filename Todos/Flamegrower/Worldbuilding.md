Basic idea: combine fantasy with solarpunk.
Fantasy races and magic coexisting with a post-capitalist human society.

## Characters

**Wood elves**:
A hunter-gatherer society living deep in the wilderness.
They rarely come into contact with humans
but are friendly with them.
They practice small-scale farming of fruits and cereals
but get most of their sustenance from the nature around them.
Their exploration trips span massive distances
and the maps they produce are some of the most sophisticated in the world.

**Dryads**:
Tree spirits of the forests with the power to manipulate plants.
The main character is one of these.
They're also expert pyromancers,
using their powers to destroy weeds
and occasionally burning down plots of forest
to create fertile soil for their farms.

**Dwarves**:
Miners living under the mountains.
They're advanced metalworkers and have access to rare earth minerals
needed to create electronics.
They build batteries, power plants and machinery,
producing much of the world's industrial technology.

**Merfolk**:
Fish-people living in lakes and shallow seas.
They grow kelp and algae in big farms
and trade it to the humans and dwarves who use it for food and biofuel.
They like fancy baroque things, wearing lots of jewelry
and building big gothic-style castles underwater to live in.

**Humans**:
City-dwellers who once thought they were the only intelligent species around.
Until they finally decided to abandon their national borders
and growth-based economies,
the more magical peoples of the world rightly considered them dangerous
and hid away from them.
They now live predominantly in small towns,
tending to their gardens and studying the natural world in their universities.
They still use advanced technology, trading knowledge and materials with the dwarves.

The story could be just the main character visiting the societies of all these folks,
clearing out the infestation of alien plants.

## Miscellaneous notes

The main enemy of the game is the infestation of an invasive alien plant species.
Maybe this plant was created by a cult worshiping the ancient fossil fuel industry?
It could be made of oil. Possible name: Hydrocarbon.
Alternatively, it could be something that was created by accident
in some science/magic experiment.
This way the story would be simpler,
as there would be no villain you have to somehow defeat,
you're just cleaning up the mess and it's done when there's none left.

Dryads can do pyromancy. What about other kinds of magic?

Given that big cities are largely abandoned, there's not much light pollution anymore.
That means night skies have lots of pretty stars!
And might as well put planets, nebulae etc. there too
since this doesn't need to be our Earth

Is there space travel? People living on the moon perhaps?
Could the infestation get there somehow?
