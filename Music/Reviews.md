Mini-reviews for my favorite metal albums of each year.
I post these yearly as threads on Twitter, collecting them
here throughout the year.

## 2020

[Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/moletrooper/status/1335580469262487554)

This one I just wrote directly on Twitter in one go.

## 2021

Still WIP (late, I know :P)

### Alustrium — A Monument To Silence

Everything I love about death metal in one album.
Technical and progressive but still groovy riffs,
impressive guitar solos and complex drum beats,
topped off with hard-hitting lyrics about mental illness
delivered with an appropriately fierce growl.

### Seven Spires — Gods of Debauchery

An incredibly diverse work of symphonic metal that
explores all sorts of subgenres from power to blackened death,
yet somehow feels like a coherent whole.
An impressive production; Adrienne Cowan's vocals in particular are on another level.

### Ophidian I — Desolate

One of those technical death metal albums that don't make sense -
how is this so insanely complicated and still so easy to listen to?
Amazing composition and mindblowing technique on the guitars and drums.

### IOTUNN — Access All Worlds

TODO

### Aephanemer — A Dream of Wilderness

Symphonic melodic death metal with a heavy emphasis on the symphonic
and a great deal of classical influence. A distinctive, upbeat sound
with the guitars driven by high-pitched melodies instead of heavy riffs.

### Wilderun — Epigone

### Shadow of Intent — Elegy

TODO

### Persefone — metanoia

An adventurous piece of prog metal featuring plenty of strange time signatures,
abrupt tone switches and technical guitar riffs. Far from easy listening
but very fun.
