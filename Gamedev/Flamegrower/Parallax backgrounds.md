Not entirely sure if this should be done with textures, meshes, or both.
I kind of want to try a mixture of flat-colored perspective 3D with
flat decoration meshes/textures for things like houses, trees etc.

Meshes would allow for some dynamic animation in the background like
windmills spinning, trees swaying etc. so it seems like the most flexible
way to make this. OTOH, if I want puffy round shapes for bushes, clouds
and such, or King's Bird -like decorative patterns, those would probably
require too many triangles. Maybe make the primary shapes out of meshes
and add decorations with textures.
