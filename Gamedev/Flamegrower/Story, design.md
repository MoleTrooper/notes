## Character design

Player character is a gardening android that manipulates plants
(vines specifically). Their task in the past has been tending to farms and gardens,
but now they must turn to their pest control capabilities as the weeds
threaten to consume the world.

### Look inspirations and ideas

Idea for the entire style: triangle meshes with vertex colors only,
"low-poly" look but for 2D. Could be animated with skinning
which would be fun.

#### Main character

Florans from Starbound and Wargroove

[More Wargroove stuff](https://wargroovewiki.com/Floran_Tribes)

Bayonetta's hair costume but with leaves?
i.e. character changes shape when shooting out a vine,
as if their whole body is/was made of that vine

Some physics-based animation for leaves on the character
could look pretty sick

Concept of my own:

#### Backgrounds

Look to The King's Bird for inspiration.
The opening scene has a particularly nice outdoor view:

Also play the game and study the parallax effects

## Gameplay contrivances

Weeds (the thing you're destroying, name subject to change)
are an invasive species of plant, perhaps a kind of antimatter
analogue for plants. They seemed indestructible at first,
but turns out they're very sensitive to the fire of flamevines.
Look: dark, void-like, squirming

Flamevines are plants burning with a special fire that only
spreads along gardening androids' vines. They were developed
for pest and weed control but turned out crucial when the weeds appeared.
They are launched into areas with weeds, and gardening androids
are sent after them to use their fire to exterminate the weeds.

## Areas

Research facility where flamevines were developed.
Possible name: Garden of Fire

Town on top of a big bridge. Built as quick emergency shelter
from the floods, before which people lived on the ground below.
Gameplay could involve going up and down the bridge pillars,
swinging around below the bridge, etc. Perhaps there are some trains
Possible name: Foothold

Town dug into a mountain, with buildings both on the floor
and hanging from the ceiling. Built there for protection from heat in the past,
and extended to the ceiling during the floods. One side of the bridge town
ends at this mountain, and a tunnel goes from there to the mine town.
Possible name: Summit

Floating islands, perhaps used for energy production
with wind/solar, farming, just living, or all of the above.
Developed during the floods when ground space was sparse.
Maybe the gardening androids were developed to move around floating farms
quickly with their vines.
Possible name: Suncatcher(s)

Newly built village on the ground. Maybe some treehouses or other fun
tall structures. Windmills?

## History

Major natural disasters happened in the past.
First came the heatwaves. People escaped them underground,
but were forced back out by the floods. During the floods most farmland
and dry ground in general was lost, leading first to the rapid construction
of bridge towns to get everyone out of the way, and later to the development
of floating islands.

While large sections of the planet are still uninhabitable,
in the area where the game takes place the waters have now receded
and life on the surface is possible again.
Some people have returned to live on the ground,
while others choose to remain up on the bridges
and floating islands where they grew up.

## Nameing

Would be cute to name all areas after metal songs / albums / bands.
Some bands with song names that could work:
- Wilderun: Garden of Fire, Suncatcher
- Countless Skies: Summit, Zephyr, Tempest
- Eluveitie: The Raven Hill, Black Water Dawn
- Be'lakor: Foothold, Hidden Window, Locus
- Dynazty: Paradise of the Architect, Apex, Ascension
- Mechina: anything from the early albums could work lol,
  lots of funky scifi words
- Kardashev: Cellar of Ghosts, anything from Peripety :P
- Rivers of Nihil: Hollow, A Home
- Aeternam: Sun Shield, Celestial Plains
- Bloodred Hourglass: Waves of Black, White Feather
- Dreamtale: Firebird
- Amaranthe: Skyline
- Sunless Rise
- Wintersun: The Forest That Weeps

Maybe other stuff in the game could be named after songs too.
Weeds could be The Grey (Dynazty), flamevines could be flamewalls (Camellia).
The flood could be called The Deluge (Sojourner). Gardening androids
could be biomechs or formshifters (Allegaeon).

(yes I'm putting way too much effort into this lol)
