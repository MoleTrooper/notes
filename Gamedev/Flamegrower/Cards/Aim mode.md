Shooting while moving is pretty difficult
(impossible without slowing down) with the current control scheme,
but I really don't want to require a mouse if I can help it.
A solution to this could be to slow down time when pressing shoot,
bringing up an aiming reticle of some kind, and only shooting the vine
when letting go. Showing where the vine will end up would
also make it much easier to aim in general.

Working on this; making it so holding down the shoot button goes
into aim mode and releasing shoots. For accessibility, it should
also be possible to make the first press toggle and the second shoot.
