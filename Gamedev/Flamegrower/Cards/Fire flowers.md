Rather than always having fire available, you only get a charge
when you collect a fire flower. Fire always available is
too much freedom - this way we can have puzzles involving
burning multiple things in one go, having to go find a
flower to get through a burnable wall, etc.

Not sure how igniting things would work. Maybe after you collect
a flower, next time you let go of one it automatically catches
fire, or maybe that's too restrictive and a separate button to do it
would be better.

Visually, having a charge available could be communicated with
player character's hair being on fire, the "battery" in the torso
area lighting up, or both (or something else entirely
if I change the character design).
