An induced [[topology]] is a topology defined
by asking that some map or collection of maps is [[Continuity (topology)|continuous]] wrt. the topology.
Formally, given set $X$, topological space $(Y, \tau')$, map $f : X \rightarrow Y$,
$$
\tau = \{f^{-1}(U) : U \in \tau'\}
$$
is a topology on $X$ called the topology induced by $f$.
Also called _initial_ topology (fi: lähtötopologia).

This topology makes $f$ continuous due to the characterization of continuity
(see [[Continuity (topology)#Alternative characterizations]])
which states that a map is continuous iff preimages of open sets are open.

The induced topology is the _coarsest_ topology on $X$ that makes $f$ continuous
because it contains exactly the sets needed to make every preimage of an open set open.

## Relative topology

$(X, \tau)$ a topological space, $A \subset X$.
Define the _inclusion map_ $\iota : A \rightarrow X$, $\iota(x) = x$.
The relative topology $\tau_A$ on $A$ is the topology induced by $\iota$,
equal to
$$
\tau_A = \{A \cap U : U \in \tau \}
$$

Example: $X = \mathbb{R}$ with standard topology, $A = [0, 1]$.
Now $[0, \frac{1}{2}[$ is open wrt. $\tau_A$ but not $\tau$.

## Multiple maps

If we have a family of topological spaces $(Y_i, \tau_i), i \in I$
and maps $f_i : X \rightarrow Y_i$
and would like all of these to be continuous,
then our induced topology $\tau$ must include at least
$$
\tau \supset \bigcup_{i \in I} \{f^{-1}(U) : U \in \tau_i\} =: \mathcal{S}
$$
however, this is not necessarily a topology
because it may not contain all unions of sets in it.
The way to obtain a topology containing all these sets
is to treat is as a [[Basis (topology)#Subbasis|subbasis]].

Definition: the topology generated by subbasis $\mathcal{S}$
is the topology on $X$ induced by the family of maps $f_i$.

## Product topology

Let $\prod_{i \in I}X_i$ be a [[product set]].
Consider projections $P_j : \prod_{i \in I}X_i \rightarrow X_j$, $P_j(x) = x_j$
(the $j$th coordinate of $x$).
The _product topology_ on $\prod_{i \in I}X_i$
is the topology induced by the projection maps $\{P_j : j \in I\}$.
A subbasis is given by
$$
\mathcal{S} = \{P^{-1}_j(U), U \in \tau_j, j \in I\}
$$

Example: $\mathbb{R}^2$ with standard topology.
The subbasis consists of horizontal and vertical strips
(preimages of projection to open intervals on both axes),
giving a topology with a basis of rectangles.

A basis for a general product topology is
$$
\mathcal{B} = \{\prod_{i \in I} U_i : U_i \in \tau_i, i \in I,
\quad \text{and } U_i \neq X_i \text{ for only finitely many }i \}
$$
i.e. all products containing one subset from each of the sets in the product
such that there are not infinitely many ones consisting of the entire set.
The last restriction is because the topology only needs to contain
finite intersections of the basis sets.
We could remove this restriction and still have a basis,
but it would contain redundant elements.

Example: if $(X, \tau_X), (Y, \tau_Y)$ are topological spaces, then
$$
\{U \times V : U \in \tau_X, V \in \tau_Y\}
$$
is a basis of the product topology on $X \times Y$.
