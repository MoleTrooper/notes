The separation axioms (fi: erotteluaksioomat) categorize [[Topology|topological spaces]]
based on how "easily" the topology can tell different points and sets apart.
The axioms are
1. Topological space $X$ is $T_0$ (Kolmogorov)
  if for all distinct $x,y \in X$ exists $U \subset X$
  which is a neighborhood of $x$ or $y$ such that $y \notin U$ or $x \notin U$.
2. $X$ is $T_1$ (Frechet)
  if for all distinct $x,y \in X$ exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ s.t. $y \notin U$.
  (i.e. existence of separating neighborhood doesn't depend on order of the points).
3. $X$ is $T_2$ ([[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]])
  if for all distinct $x,y \in X$ exists neighborhood $U$ of $x$ and $V$ of $y$ s.t. $U \cap V = \emptyset$.
  In short, distinct points have disjoint neighborhoods.
4. $X$ is $T_3$ if it is Hausdorff and _regular_ (fi: säännöllinen):
  for all $x \in X$, $F \subset X$ closed with $x \notin F$
  exists neighborhoods $U$ of $x$ and $V$ of $F$ such that $U \cap V = \emptyset$.
  In short, points and closed sets have disjoint neighborhoods.
5. $X$ is $T_4$ if it is Hausdorff and _normal_:
  for all disjoint closed $F,G \subset X$
  exists neighborhoods $U$ of $F$ and $V$ of $G$ such that $U \cap V = \emptyset$.
  In short, disjoint closed sets have disjoint neighborhoods.

In addition with _metrizable_ spaces (ones where the topology can be induced by a metric)
these form a hierarchy:
$\text{metrizable} \implies T_4 \implies T_3 \implies T_2 \implies T_1 \implies T_0$.
Note that none of the implications are equivalences.

## Alternative characterizations

- $T_1 \iff$ singletons are closed
- regular $\iff$ $\forall\,x \in X$, $U$ neighborhood of $x$
  exists $V$ neighborhood of $x$ s.t. $\overline{V} \subset U$
- normal $\iff$ $\forall\,F \subset X$ closed, $U$ neighborhood of $F$
  exists $V$ neighborhood of $F$ s.t. $\overline{V} \subset U$

## Examples

$X = \{1,2\}$, $\tau = \{\emptyset, X\}$. $X$ is not $T_0$.

$X = \mathbb{R}$, $\tau = \{]-\infty, x[\, : x \in \mathbb{R}\} \cup \{\emptyset, \mathbb{R}\}$.
$\mathbb{R}$ is $T_0$ but not $T_1$.

$\mathbb{R}$ with co-countable topology is $T_1$ but not $T_2$.

Let $K := \{\frac{1}{n}, n \in \mathbb{N}\}$.
Now $\mathcal{B}_K := \{]a, b[ : a < b\} \cup \{]a, b[ \setminus K, a < b\}$
if a basis for some topology $\tau_K$ on $\mathbb{R}$.
$\mathcal{B}_K$ contains a basis of the standard topology $\tau_S$
$\implies \tau_K \supset \tau_S \implies \tau_K$ is Hausdorff ($T_2$).
However, $(\mathbb{R}, \tau_K)$ is not regular
because $K$ is closed in $\tau_K$ but $0$ and $K$ have no disjoint neighborhoods
$\implies$ not $T_3$.

Sorgenfrey line $\mathbb{R}_l$: $\mathbb{R}$ with topology generated by $\mathcal{B} = \{[a, b[ : a < b\}$.
The Sorgenfrey plane $\mathbb{R}_l \times \mathbb{R}_l$ is $T_3$ but not $T_4$
(proof too complicated for this course).
