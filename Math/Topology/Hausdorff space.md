A topological space ([[Topology]]) is called _Hausdorff_
if every pair of distinct points can be separated by disjoint neighborhoods,
i.e. if $x, y \in X, x \neq y$, then there exist neighborhoods
$x \in U, y \in V$ such that $U \cap V = \emptyset$.

Hausdorff spaces are also called $T_2$ spaces.

All _metrizable_ (see [[Topology#Examples]]) spaces are Hausdorff.
