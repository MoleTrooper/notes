A Cauchy sequence is an ordered set of points $x_m,\,m = 1,2,\dots$
for which the distance between successive points
converges towards zero.

More precisely, a sequence $x_m$ is a Cauchy sequence if
for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$d(x_i, x_j) < \varepsilon$ for all $i, j \geq N$
where $d$ is a [[metric]].

A metric space where all Cauchy sequences
converge to a point within that space
is called a [[complete space]].
