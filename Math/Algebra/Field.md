A field $F$ is a [[ring]] with the following extra properties:
- multiplication is commutative
- addition and multiplication have inverses:
  for every $a \in F$, there are $-a$ such that $a + (-a) = 0$
  and $a^{-1}$ such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$

In other words, a commutative ring where subtraction and division are also defined
(constructed as addition and multiplication by the inverse).

Examples of fields include the rational, real, and complex numbers.
Note that this is not the same thing as a [[vector field]].
It is also a distinct concept from a [[vector space]],
although related as a vector space is defined over a field of scalars.
