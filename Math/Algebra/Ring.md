[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics))

A ring is a set $R$ with two binary operations,
addition ($+$) and multiplication ($\cdot$)
with the following properties:
- $R$ is an _abelian [[group]]_ under addition
  (i.e. $+$ is associative, commutative, and has an identity $0$ and inverse)
- $R$ is a _monoid_ under multiplication
  (i.e. $\cdot$ is associative and has an identity $1$)
- Multiplication is distributive under addition
  (i.e. $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)$ and $(b + c) \cdot a = (b \cdot a) + (c \cdot a)$)

If multiplication is also commutative, the structure is called a _commutative ring_.
An example of a commutative ring is $\mathbb{Z}$ with the usual addition and multiplication.
An example of a non-commutative ring is the $n \times n$ matrices
with matrix addition and multiplication.
