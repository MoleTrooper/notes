An equivalence relation $\sim$ on a set $X$ is a binary relation
for which the following properties hold:
- $x \sim x$ (reflexivity)
- $x \sim y \implies y \sim x$ (symmetry)
- $x \sim y$ and $y \sim z \implies x \sim z$ (transitivity).

The _equivalence class_ of a point $x \in X$ is 
the set of points that are equivalent to $x$ under $\sim$,
denoted $[x] := \{y \in X : y \sim x\}$.
The set of all equivalence classes of $X$
is called the [[quotient set]]
and due to the axioms of the equivalence relation
it's a collection of disjoint subsets of $X$.
