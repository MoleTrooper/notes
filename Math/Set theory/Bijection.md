[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection)

A map $f : X \rightarrow Y$ where $X$ and $Y$ are sets
is an _injection_, also called _one-to-one_,
if $x = y \iff f(x) = f(y)$.

$f$ is a _surjection_, also called _onto_,
if $f[X] = Y$, i.e. for all $y \in Y$ exists $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$.

If $f$ is an injection and a surjection,
it is a _bijection_, also called a _one-to-one correspondence_.

Some special cases of bijections
include [[Isometry]], [[Homeomorphism]],
linear maps ([[Matrix]]).
