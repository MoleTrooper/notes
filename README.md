These are my notes on all sorts of (mostly math and programming
related) subjects, taken using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). They're primarily for my
personal use and *very* incomplete at the moment (I only just got started),
but made public on GitHub so I can easily share note pages with friends,
teachers, coworkers etc.

If you happen to stumble upon this repo, feel free to dig around -
there's no compromising personal information or workplace secrets here.
Most of the Obsidian-flavored Markdown should be readable on GitHub,
but internal links and embedded LaTeX won't work. For the best experience,
clone and open with Obsidian.
