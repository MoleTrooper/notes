These are my notes on all sorts of (mostly math and programming
related) subjects, taken using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). They're primarily for my
personal use and built in a very ad-hoc, not very thorough way,
but made public on GitHub so I can easily share pages with friends,
teachers, coworkers etc.

Also in this repo are some todos and ideas for my hobby projects
using Obsidian's Kanban board extension, as well as some notes and
learning diaries for university courses.

Feel free to dig around if you feel like it â€”
there's no compromising personal information or workplace secrets here.
Most of the Obsidian-flavored Markdown should be readable on GitHub
(even embedded LaTeX is supported these days!), though a few things
like Obsidian's internal link format don't work.
You can also clone the repo and open it in Obsidian,
where everything works out of the box
with the exception of Kanban boards, which require the Kanban
extension from the Obsidian community plugin marketplace.
