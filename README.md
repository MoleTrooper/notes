These are my notes on all sorts of (mostly math and programming
related) subjects, taken using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). They're primarily for my
personal use and *very* incomplete at the moment (I only just got started),
but made public on GitHub so I can easily share pages with friends,
teachers, coworkers etc.

Also in this repo are some todos and ideas for my hobby projects
using Obsidian's Kanban board extension, as well as some learning diaries
for university courses.

If you happen to stumble upon this repo, feel free to dig around -
there's no compromising personal information or workplace secrets here.
Most of the Obsidian-flavored Markdown should be readable on GitHub,
but internal links and embedded LaTeX won't work. For the best experience,
clone and open with Obsidian.
