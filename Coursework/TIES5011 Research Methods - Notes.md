## Week 1: Systematic literature mapping & review

Both types of studies are about collecting as much of the literature
in a chosen field as possible. The objective of mapping studies
a meta-analysis/inventory of work in the field, examining things like recent trends,
whereas reviews gather evidence on specific topics and draw conclusions from it.
Mapping studies can serve as inputs for reviews, reusing the search
and taking a closer look at the results of articles found.

Important to both kinds is the methodology of selecting literature to include.
There must be well-defined selection criteria so that the work can be evaluated
objectively and repeated. However, applying rules for classification and
selection to articles in a consistent manner is quite difficult.

Summary of important considerations:
- must have a well-defined research question
- must have clear rules for classifying and selecting articles to include,
  which should aim to answer the research question.
	- guidelines exist for these which should be cited to make evaluation easier
- process of searching for articles should also be documented;
  keywords and search engines used etc. as well as the methods of
  coming up with keywords and testing the completeness of the search
- gathering a broad starting set is crucial. With articles from multiple
  communities, publishers, times etc. the "snowball" stage
  (gathering citations of the starting set) is effective
	- it can't ever be known whether the entire field is covered though,
	  we can only give an educated guess
- multiple people should participate in the selection process
  to reduce likelihood of biased results
- validity threats (reasons why the results may be incorrect or invalid,
  e.g. researcher bias or poorly defined classification criteria)
  should be discussed and mitigated

Tasks to perform when doing a study like this (paraphrased from
Petersen et al. (2008) and Kitchenham & Charters (2007)):
1. planning
	- identify need and specify research questions and scope
	- develop a protocol for search, review, etc.
2. conducting
	- gather articles using the selected search strategy
	- develop the search further based on initial results (snowball etc.)
	- evaluate the search results (is this a good sample of the population)
	- possibly extract data relevant to the research questions
	  and synthesize summarizing data
3. reporting
	- disseminate (i.e. publish and promote) the results:
	  journals, press releases, posters, websites etc.
	- create appropriate formats of the report for all release platforms
	- possibly solicit peer review if publishing outside of journals
	  (where review is always done)
