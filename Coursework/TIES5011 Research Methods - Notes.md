## Week 1: Systematic literature mapping & review

Both types of studies are about collecting as much of the literature
in a chosen field as possible. The objective of mapping studies
a meta-analysis/inventory of work in the field, examining things like recent trends,
whereas reviews gather evidence on specific topics and draw conclusions from it.

Important to both kinds is the methodology of selecting literature to include.
There must be well-defined selection criteria so that the work can be evaluated
objectively and repeated.
