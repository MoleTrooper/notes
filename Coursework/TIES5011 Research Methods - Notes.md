## Week 1: Systematic literature mapping & review

Both types of studies are about collecting a representative sample
of all the literature in a field/topic of research.
The objective of mapping studies is a summary/inventory
of work in the field, examining things like recent trends,
whereas reviews gather evidence on a specific topic and aim
to produce new conclusions via quantitative analysis.
Mapping studies can serve as inputs for reviews, reusing the search
and taking a closer look at the results of articles found.

Tasks to perform when doing a study like this (paraphrased from
Petersen et al. (2008) and Kitchenham & Charters (2007)):
1. planning
	- identify need, specify research questions and scope
	- develop a protocol for search, review, etc. and evaluate it
2. conducting
	- gather articles using your search strategy
	- select your starting set of studies from these
	  using your selection criteria
	- develop the search further based on initial results (snowball etc.)
	- evaluate the search results (is this a good sample of the population)
	- possibly extract data relevant to the research questions
	  and synthesize summarizing data
3. reporting
	- disseminate (i.e. publish and promote) the results:
	  journals, press releases, posters, websites etc.
	- create appropriate formats of the report for all release platforms
	- possibly solicit peer review if publishing outside of journals
	  (for journals review is done by the journal)
	  
Important considerations:
- must have a well-defined research question
- must have clear rules for classifying and selecting articles
  to include and exclude, which should aim for a representative sample
  of all research on the topic
	- guidelines exist for these which should be cited to make evaluation easier
- process of searching for articles should also be documented;
  keywords and search engines used etc. as well as the methods of
  coming up with keywords and testing the completeness of the search.
- the goal of the last two points is to make the process repeatable
- gathering a broad starting set is crucial. With articles from multiple
  communities, publishers, times etc. the "snowball" stage
  (gathering citations of the starting set) is effective
	- it can't ever be known whether the entire field is covered though,
	  we can only give an educated guess
- multiple people should participate in the selection process
  to reduce likelihood of biased results
- validity threats (reasons why the results may be incorrect or invalid,
  e.g. researcher bias or poorly defined classification criteria)
  should be discussed and mitigated
- tooling for bibliography management is very important at this scale

For a master's thesis, this is an attractive kind of study for those
looking to continue to a PhD because it gives the student a good
overview of their field of choice early on in their studies.
However, doing a study like this thoroughly is a very
large amount of work, likely too much for many students.
Since it's very similar to our usual literature review bachelor's thesis,
only with additional depth and rigor, similar topics such as my
review of real-time fluid simulation techniques would be applicable.
