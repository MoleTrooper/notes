From the faculty instructions:

A good research plan should include the following answers and information.
**Basic information**
- Your name and affiliation
- Topic, i.e. title of the thesis (project)
	- discrete exterior calculus for fluid flow phenomena
**Background**
- Brief introduction to the research field (including relevant references)
	- I can probably get most of this directly from master's thesis
- Motivation for the topic (Why is it important?)
	- engineering applications
	- more efficient methods -> faster iteration or more complex simulations
**Objectives and methods**
- Define clearly the research question(s) (What are you going to study?)
	- how can different fluid flow models (navier-stokes, maxwell-vlasov, boltzmann) be discretized with DEC?
	    what are the accuracy and performance characteristics of the discrete models?
- Describe the methods (How are you going to answer the questions?)
	- derive discrete models by DEC principles, implement simulations, measure
- Possible hypotheses (depending on the methods)
	- diagonal Hodge stars result in efficient time-stepping procedures -> efficiency should be competitive
	- mesh quality is an issue, maybe try HOT or something
**Results**
- What kinds of results are expected? (tool, framework, new theory, new technical solutions, etc.)
	- new information about an existing mathematical framework, new discrete mathematical models
	- new technical solutions: dexterior, simulation implementations
- Practical relevance of the expected results (How to apply the results?)
	- new models and technical implementations usable in engineering applications
	- new knowledge about capabilities of DEC useful for choosing simulation methods
- Are you planning to do write a monograph or a compilation dissertation (introduction +
  collection of scientific articles)?
	- compilation
**Timetable**
- Schedule your research (main phases of the research and timetable for them)
	- timetable depends on funding
	- first: article about acoustic wave stuff from master's thesis
	- then, experimenting with new models (order doesn't particularly matter)
- Publication plan (if you are going to publish articles): initial topics and publication schedule
	- acoustics with DEC and exact controllability - first year
	- year or two break for study and development
	- then navier-stokes
	- maxwell-vlasov and boltzmann probably fairly shortly after
**Resources and collaboration**
- How is your topic related to the precious/ongoing research in the Faculty of Information
  Technology / University of Jyväskylä? (connections to research groups / ongoing research projects)
	- scientific computing research group
- National and international research collaboration (planned or already existing connections)
- Other collaboration (companies, other organizations, etc.)
