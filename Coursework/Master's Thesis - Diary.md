Started writing this diary a bit late; initially didn't mean to at all
but I felt like I was forgetting things and struggling to stay focused
and thought this might help.

## Summary of September 2020 (20h)

Read Räbinä's PhD thesis on solving the Maxwell equations.
Got a vague intuitive idea of meshes, dual meshes, Hodge operators,
the controllability method etc.

Spent a lot of time browsing the internet trying to understand the
adjoint state method. I get the algebraic proof using the Lagrangian,
but I'm still having trouble getting an intuitive understanding of what
this is doing.

## 2022-10-03 (2h)

Reading some more about the adjoint state method, also took a detour to read
a bit of a more recent paper by Räbinä et al. which didn't turn out to
be very useful for me right now. Starting to get the idea a bit (writing about it
in the [[Scratchpad]] note for now), but still a little hazy.

## 2022-10-04 (1.5h)

Working through the derivation for the adjoint state equation
by writing it down step by step, helped a bit to understand where it comes
from but still struggling to visualize it.
Should move on from this topic for now I think.

## 2022-10-08 (2h)

Reading about weak formulations of PDEs. I have a basic understanding
of what they are now, but didn't get far enough to actually derive
it for our wave equation yet.

## 2022-10-10 (2.5h)

Looked at test problems (problems with known solutions for testing
implementations) a bit, then digressed into reading more about
differential forms. This intro paper on them is very good,
will finish reading it tomorrow and get back to what I was doing.

## 2022-10-11 (2h)

Finished reading the intro paper on differential forms. Learned a lot
about what they are, why they can be used to generate an exact discretization,
what exactly the exterior derivative and Hodge star do, etc.
Will have to return to this another day to finish writing down notes.

## 2022-10-12 (2h)

Got Räbinä's code examples compiling and running on my machine
and spent some time going over documents to talk about at tomorrow's meeting.

## 2022-10-14 (3h)

Started looking into the code example from Jonni and putting together a
vim C++ setup, but quickly got sidetracked into trying out Papis
for bibliography management. Concluded it wasn't as good as Zotero.

## 2022-10-18 (2.5h)

Continuing to look over the example code, more or less understand it now.
I'll try to write some code of my own next time.

## 2022-10-20 (2h)

Started writing an answer to Jonni's exercise, not quite sure how
the Hodge star works w.r.t. vector calculus differential operators
but getting the hang of using the GFD library.

## 2022-10-21 (2h)

Reorganized my work into a different repo outside of gfd
and finished Jonni's exercise.

## 2022-11-05 (3h)

Had to take some time away to focus on the research methods course.
Getting back to this now, looking at numerical integration a bit
and starting to work on the wave problem for the actual thesis.

## 2022-11-06 (5h)

Working on a differential form formulation of the Helmholtz equation,
got it done to a point where I think I can try coding something next time.
