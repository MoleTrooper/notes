Notes I felt like quickly writing down without figuring out a structured place for them.
Hopefully I've moved most things to more appropriate places and this file is close to empty.

## Random words I haven't categorized yet

Involution: a function that is its own inverse, $f(f(x)) = x$

Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(x, \lambda) = f(x) + \lambda g(x)$: formulation of an optimization problem
$\min f(x) \text{ s.t. } g(x) = 0$ that allows finding the solution of the constrained system
by finding points where $\nabla \mathcal{L}(x, \lambda) = 0$.
