Friction is much stronger in one direction than the other -
this is very visible in Flamegrower when trying to push a block.
Initially thought it was just static friction but the problem
persists with dynamic friction; just less noticeable because
it doesn't completely stop movement.

I suspect this is because of contact processing order
and *might* be resolved by adding a
[[Block solver for two-point contacts]].
