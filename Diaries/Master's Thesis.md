Started writing this diary a bit late; initially didn't mean to at all
but I felt like I was forgetting things and struggling to stay focused
and thought this might help.

## Summary of what I've done so far (20h)

Read R채bin채's PhD thesis on solving the Maxwell equations.
Got a vague intuitive idea of meshes, dual meshes, Hodge operators,
the controllability method etc.

Spent a lot of time browsing the internet trying to understand the
adjoint state method. I get the algebraic proof using the Lagrangian,
but I'm still having trouble getting an intuitive understanding of what
this is doing.

Reading some more about the adjoint state method, also took a detour to read
a bit of a more recent paper by R채bin채 et al. which didn't turn out to
be very useful for me right now. Starting to get the idea a bit (writing about it
in the [[Scratchpad]] note for now), but still a little hazy.

Working through the derivation for the adjoint state equation
by writing it down step by step, helped a bit to understand where it comes
from but still struggling to visualize it. Done with this topic for now I think.
