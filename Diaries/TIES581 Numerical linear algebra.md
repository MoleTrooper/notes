# TIES581 Numerical linear algebra

Self study course administered by Raino MÃ¤kinen. [Materials](http://users.jyu.fi/~rainom/numlin/)

This is a learning diary documenting my study sessions and what I learned each time.

Started reading the first chapter of Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear
Systems (henceforth called the linear systems book). It glosses over some
details and operates in complex vector spaces which I don't really understand,
but for the most part I know enough about real matrix math to follow.

The part linking QR factorization and the process of orthonormalization
(Gram-Schmidt / Householder algorithms) made QR factorization click for me. I
never really intuited when and why it exists and what its geometric meaning is
before.
