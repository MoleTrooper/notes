# TIES581 Numerical linear algebra

Self study course administered by Raino MÃ¤kinen. [Materials](http://users.jyu.fi/~rainom/numlin/)

This is a learning diary documenting my study sessions and what I learned each time.

Started reading the first chapter of Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear
Systems (henceforth called the linear systems book). It glosses over some
details and operates in complex vector spaces which I don't really understand,
but for the most part I know enough about real matrix math to follow.

The part linking QR factorization and the process of orthonormalization
(Gram-Schmidt / Householder algorithms) made QR factorization click for me. I
never really intuited when and why it exists and what its geometric meaning is
before.

Setting up note-taking with Obsidian and writing down a lot of basic
information about [[Matrices|matrices]], using the first chapter of the linear systems book
as primary source. I'm only just getting started with this note collection
so I'm writing a lot about things I already knew before, but having this
information written down is going to come in handy in years to come.

I'm going through all the types of
[[Matrices#Descriptors|special matrices]] like diagonal,
triangular, orthogonal etc., writing down their definitions and
thinking about their effects as linear transformations.
